### SOCKET-CHAT-APP 
-This is a simple web application that leverages the Websocket Transmission Protocol.
- It uses the Socket.IO technology
- ### Socket IO is an event-driven framework used for bidirectional communication between a client and a server. It is mainly used for broadcasting messages to all connected clients in a particular server just like WhatsApp group chats. This framework is event-driven, which means that the client and server will respond to events sent by each other.
- The chat application was build using <b>socket.io, Node JS, expressJs.</b> As Node JS can handle events, socket.io serves as a great framework for integration with Node JS.

- Tailwind was used for the styling of the chat application
